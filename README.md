# Data Analysis Project Part 2: Take binary decisions using statistical analysis
Part two of two; make a data and statistical analysis of abalones population in California; keep in mind this is a basisc tatistical analysis for academic purposes.

<h2 align="left">Abstract</h2>

<p align="justify">In the last paper the main objective was to understand the whole data, its structure and possible variations on it to determine if data is normally distributed or present any abnormal values that can influence the results, this all with the goal to understand failure in Abalone data gathering and how to improve it. In this second delivery, the primary objective of this assignment is to devise and evaluate binary decision rules for harvesting abalones, improving the possibilities of abalone population growing by statistically defining which abalones are better to harvest and determining the tradeoffs involve in this investigation and decision making.
